# CRUD-PROJECT
A Simple CRUD system that works with MySQL Server.

### How it works

- The system mainly uses the QT framework **PyQT5**.
- MySQL.connector module was used for the Database Interaction

# How to use
Here's the basic instruction on how to use the software.

### Install MySQL Server
- Download and Install the MySQL Server in this link: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/

### Downlad the latest release of the software
- Extract the files in your system

# Notes
- As of now, the loading of data is very slow at **O(N^3)**. Avoid using a database with large amount of tables and data it might result into crashes.
- **Date** datatype are poorly supported.
- Only the **main features** of CRUD operations are supported. We hope that other features will be implemented in the future.
